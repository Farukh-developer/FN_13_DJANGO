                <p>
                    The IELTS test dates in India are available four times a month or 48 times a year (for paper-based) and are generally held <br>
                    on Saturdays and Thursdays to provide flexibility and convenience to the test seekers. If you opt for computer-delivered IELTS,<br>
                    you can choose from multiple dates and time slots and get your results within 3-5 days. However, the availability of the IELTS <br>
                    dates may differ as per the test type and module you have opted for - Academic or General Training.

                </p>

                    Why choose IELTS?

                    It is the test for study − Thousands of the world’s most reputable universities and colleges accept IELTS results as evidence <br>
                    of English language proficiency.
                    It is the test for professionals − Professional registration bodies in many fields including accounting, <br>
                    engineering, law, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and teaching bodies in many countries accept IELTS scores. This <br>
                    implies that you’ll need to take the IELTS to gain professional registration in an English-speaking country.

                    It is the test for migration – Most governments prefer IELTS scores as proof of your language <br>
                    skills than any other English language test as a requirement for permanent residency. Unlike other providers, <br>
                    the IELTS General Training test is the only non-academic test available for migration to Australia, New Zealand, <br>
                    Canada, the United Kingdom, and the USA.
